naoRemote
=========

naoRemote is a demo for remote control NAO by mobile device

I use websocket protocol to communicate between NAO and mobile device.
It needs pywebsocket as the socket server on the NAO.

You can use any mobile device's browser which support websocket feature to connect with NAO' sever.
Then use web interface to control NAO's behavior.
